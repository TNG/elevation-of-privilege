This packages contains a modified version of the [OWASP Cornucopia](https://owasp.org/www-project-cornucopia/) card deck, which was developed at the OWASP foundation.
The modifications are the location of the value on the cards and a removal of references to other OWASP tools which are not relevant to the elevation-of-privilege online game.
