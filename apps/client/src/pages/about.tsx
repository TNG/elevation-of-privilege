                <p>
                  The Elevation of Privilege game is designed to be the easiest
                  way to start looking at your design from a security
                  perspective. It&apos;s one way to threat model, intended to be
                  picked up and used by any development group.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because the game uses STRIDE threats, it gives you a framework
                  for thinking, and specific actionable examples of those
                  threats.
                </p>

                <p>
                  An Elevation of Privilege game is usually initiated for one of
                  a few reasons. Those include because a group of developers has
                  a system or feature to threat model, because someone wants to
                  learn or teach the skill, or because someone has picked up a
                  copy of the game and wants to explore.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is a super-set of all non-game motivations to threat
                  model. In any case, it is important to start with a system to
                  be threat modelled, and an architectural diagram of that
                  system should be available. A whiteboard diagram is ideal if
                  participants agree it is reasonably accurate and it shows
                  programs, data flows and data stores. For this version of the
                  game, players should use a model created on{' '}
                  <a
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    href="https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/"
                  >
                    Threat Dragon
                  </a>
                  . If no such model exists, it needs to be created before play
                  starts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Players need a way to track bugs hence using a Threat Dragon
                  model is ideal.
                </p>
                <h2>How to play</h2>
                <p>
                  Play starts by dealing out the entire deck (which is
                  automatically done when the game is created), and ensuring
                  players are familiar with the rules.
                </p>
                <h2>Rules</h2>
                <p>
                  A player (most likely an engineer) developing the system would
                  explain the diagram to everyone playing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Play starts with the player with the 3 of Tampering, and then
                  proceeds clockwise around the table in tricks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The game has two phases, <strong>Play</strong> and{' '}
                  <strong>Threat Identification</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the <strong>Play</strong> phase, the current player would
                  only be able to navigate through the diagram and/or select
                  components.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When a card is dealt, the{' '}
                  <strong>Threat Identification</strong> phase begins and
                  players in any order can interact with the model and add
                  threats or pass.
                </p>
                <p>After all players pass, only then would the play resume.</p>
                <p>
                  Each trick is played &apos;in&apos; the suit that was led.
                  That is, each player must play a card of that suit if they
                  have one. Playing a card consists of reading it aloud, and
                  explaining how it applies to the system being threat modelled
                  and the component affected. The players can record their
                  threat by selecting the component and adding the associated
                  threat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Playing a card where a player knows of a compensating control
                  is less exciting, but still valid, because it allows for
                  discussion of compensating controls, and helps newcomers to
                  threat modelling understand the cycle of discovery and
                  mitigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the player has no cards left in the suit that was led, then
                  they may play a card from any suit, the game does that
                  automatically and only valid cards are available to be played.
                  After each player has played a card, the trick is won by the
                  player who has played the highest card in either the suit that
                  was led or in the &apos;trump&apos; suit, Elevation of
                  Privilege.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The highest card is the highest value card played in the suit
                  led, unless there was one or more trump card played. If a
                  trump card has been played, the highest value trump card is
                  the winning card.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A point is awarded for every threat identified and for every
                  hand that is won.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The final model with the threats can be downloaded at the end
                  of the game.

                  The motivation for creating this online version of the game at
                  Careem was due to a large number of teams working remotely
                  across several geographies and we wanted to scale our method
                  of teaching threat modeling to our engineering teams.
